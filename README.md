# Activity_prediction
Activity prediction models are established to predict the activity information. The repository includes models of the recreation of the TimeGeo model and the updated Activity Scheduler model.

## Sequential Activity Scheduler Model

This repository contains the Sequential Activity Scheduler Model, a model for predicting sequential activities. It uses a decision tree algorithm and is trained with data from the 2010-2012 California Household Survey. 

### Model Components

The model has two components: The Activity Type Model (ATM) and the Activity Duration Model (ADM). 

#### Activity Type Model (ATM)
The ATM uses a decision tree model to predict the type of the next activity based on individual attributes and the current activity's end time. It involves two key mechanisms: the 'back and stay-home mechanisms which categorize individuals into employed, student, or other, and a splitting mechanism which divides the samples based on the activity's end time.

The tree's nodes are split based on maximizing information gain and continue to split until the information gain is lower than a set threshold (in this case, 0.02). 

#### Activity Duration Model (ADM)
The ADM uses the activity type determined by the ATM and other context features (such as end time of current activity, gender, driverâ€™s license state, and education) to determine the duration of the next activity. Unlike the ATM, which outputs a discrete probability distribution, the ADM models a continuous one. 

### Sequential Activity Prediction
The model generates sequential activities, starting with the first activities and personal attributes in the dataset, and continues to generate activities until the activity type is predicted as 'none'. 

## TimeGeo Recreation (CHTS)

This project focuses on recreating the TimeGeo model using the California Household Travel Survey (CHTS) dataset. The model is divided into two parts: Temporal Choices and Spatial Choices.

### Temporal Choices

Temporal choices are modeled using a time-inhomogeneous Markov model with a 5-minute resolution. The model classifies individuals into non-commuters and commuters, and further classifies commuters into those taking work trips and those taking non-work trips.

The code for this part can be found in the `temporal_choice` directory.

#### Parameter Estimation

Three parameters are estimated: 

1. Number of home-based tours (Nw) 
2. Dwell rate (Beta1) 
3. Burst rate (Beta2)

The parameters are estimated by minimizing the prediction error of activity duration and the number of trips per day.

#### Results

The temporal choice model captures the trip number patterns effectively. It can reasonably explain the drop in the number of trips when the number of trips is 3. However, it struggles to predict long-duration trips.

### Spatial Choices

Spatial choices are modeled using the rank-based exploration (r-EPR) model. The model randomly selects points in census tracts based on frequency.

The code for this part can be found in the `spatial_choice` directory.

#### Return Probability

In the model, the return probability is close to zero, given the duration of only a single day.

#### Rank-based Exploration

The model follows a rank-based exploration pattern where the probability of a location being visited is inversely proportional to its rank.
